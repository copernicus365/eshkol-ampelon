# Video / Audio Conversion

FFMPEG for the win!

## `.mkv` to `.mp3`

With terminal location in same dir as `input.mkv`:

`ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:a libmp3lame output.mp3`

Works!

## Batch

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5784661/how-do-you-convert-an-entire-directory-with-ffmpeg

`for i in *.{mkv,mp4}(.N); do ffmpeg -i "$i" -c:a libmp3lame "${i%.*}.mp3"; done`


## Loop problems

`for i in *.mp4(.N) *.mkv(.N) *.txt(.N) *.md(.N); do echo "cool: $i"; done`

(KEY was `(.N)` part! was failing otherwise... is STUPID that is needed nonetheless...)
