(TDOT) ערץ
עָרַץ ʿāraṣ; עָרִיץ ʿārîṣ; מַעֲרָצָה maʿarāṣâ; עָרוּץ ʿārûṣ
+
TDOT: "The reason for the bipolarity in the hiphil is that it functions either as a causative (Isa. 8:13, maʿarîṣ, "who inspires fear") or as a declarative (possibly as a denominative from ʿārîṣ) (8:12, taʿarîṣû, "you acknowledge to be fear-inducing," i.e., "you fear").

"The Deuteronomistic exhortations to Israel to be fearless in battle against enemy peoples (Dt. 1:29; 7:21; 20:3; 31:6; Josh. 1:9) use the verb in the qal together with forms of the more common roots yrʾ, ḥtt, and ḥpz, "fear." The rhetorical peculiarity of our words lies in the emphasis it lends to a statement by virtue of its lower frequency. On the basis of its etymology and use elsewhere, we can recognize its specific semantic nuance as denoting faintheartedness manifested in a physical response: "start, shrink back."
