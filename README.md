# eshkol-ampelon

Hebrew and Greek language study materials (some on Quizlet, etc)

See my [Eshkol Kai Ampelon quizlet class and sets here](https://quizlet.com/class/26212081/).

## Exports

There's nothing to keep these current short of manually updating these, but this gives me great peace of mind, after putting so much effort into these. This also gives an immediate ability to share this content, apart from Quizlet being up, etc. These backups also allow peace of mind if some or much of one of these sets got altered or deleted, every time I export and save it here, git saves that record. God bless git and github :)
