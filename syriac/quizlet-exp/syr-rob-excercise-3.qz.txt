their heads
"That's the noun rish, after the sheen their is a yod with a dipthong maintained, which dipthong in Hebrew becomes a sere [!]"

ܥܠܱܘܗ̱ܝ

"upon him"

IJ: "The patach is on the lamed. The ayin is in the pretonic sheva position, whereas in Hebrew you would have there a big qametz. In Syriac the heh has been blocked, and therefore what you do is you pronounce first an ayin with a sheva, which in Jewish Aramaic would take hataf-patach. The lamed with the patach in combination with the waw gives you a dipthong, and you do your best to accomodate the yod at the end. You realize this is the 'Alohi' form that we have both in biblical Aramaic and in the Targumim, with the "Hawaiian" ending. So "'alohi" becomes "alaw": upon him.
