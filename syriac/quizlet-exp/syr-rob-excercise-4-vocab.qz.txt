Robinson note 5 (on which I wrote: 'Great importance'), with notes I have in my book (from class notes? ie from IJ? I assume): "The ܒ̣ is soft because a short vowel [I wrote: 'דְּהַב'] stood before it originally, cf. Hebrew זָהָב." I wrote: ie "was a standard"... I think my point was: great evidence here this little archaic clue that the Syriac forms originally evolved from like what we have in BA / JA...

Huge notes on ܐܶ by IJ: "the *theme vowel*, patach, over the mem. The aleph is on the sheva position, and since Syriac does not like to have an aleph in a sheva position, it grants it a full vowel. It's a bonanza, that comes from the heavens. It is not a vowel that normally should be there, but it is there to salvage the aleph." Brilliantly compared to Atlanta -> 'tlanta, or Electric -> Lectric, "we have the same danger here so you grant it a full vowel..." Note, similar dynamic but I guess in the reverse, with ܝܰܕ -> ܐܺܝܕ̣ܳܐ, in that case adding the aleph, which helps to preverve the vowel / R1 yod-consonant.

"But basically the aleph is in a sheva position, and the main vowel is the patach over the mem"

IJ: "you may think this is a derived stem, an aphel, but then if it's an aphel, how come the aleph is not vocalized with a patah. It's not an aphel it's a qal, the aleph is prosthetic because you have a cluster of a sibilant shin with a tav, and this is a problem in many languages. So a little aleph is added... specially -> especially"

sibilant: "Of, characterized by, or producing a hissing sound like that of (s) or (sh)."

our first (basically) qal stativ vocalization, "which we don't have in Hebrew, 3rd weak
