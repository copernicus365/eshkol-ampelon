IJ insightful explantion of uncharacteristic 3rd weak masc. pl. ܙܶܝܢ: "and what you have here is the אַיִן of בָּנַיִן, 'building' (in Daniel Aramaic), Hebrew בֹּנִים, well that dipthong אַיִ becomes an 'ey' ܙܶܝ in Syriac, which is pretty much against Syriac's nature, because Syriac likes dipthongs, in this case it's the opposite, biblical Aramaic keeps the dipthong, and Syriac solves or resolves the dipthong by pushing it into becoming a long vowel. So we're going to have this constantly, a long vowel in the plural of masc. active and passive participles."
NP: Re the irregularity here, my feeling is the irregularity is precisely the point: such a fundamentally important grammatical marking often needs, or wants, to be differentiated...
