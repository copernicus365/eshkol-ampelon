IJ: "See how the suffixes behave: when they are attached to a noun in the singular, the caph is soft, whereas when they are attached to a noun which is in the plural, because of the dipthong, the caph is rough... In Hebrew the suffixes כֶם ו כֶן are always soft, irrespective of position... [makes sense in the plural but in singular...]"
