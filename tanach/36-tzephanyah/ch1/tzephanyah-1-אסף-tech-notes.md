# Tzephanyah 1:2 - אָסֹ֨ף אָסֵ֜ף

- 1:2
אָסֹ֨ף אָסֵ֜ף

- shockingly LHB and BHS points אָסֵ֜ף as a participle!: 

"סוף; verb, Hiphil, participle, ms abs.: 'bring to an end'"

- NET note:
> tn The Hebrew text combines the infinitive absolute of אָסַף (’asaf, “gather up, sweep away”) with a Hiphil prefixed first person form of סוּף (suf, “come to an end”; see Jer 8:13 for the same combination). This can be translated literally, “Sweeping away, I will bring to an end.” Some prefer to emend the text so that the infinitive and finite form of the verb are from the same root (“I will certainly sweep away,” if from אָסַף [cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV]; “I will certainly bring to an end,” if from סוּף). For a discussion of proposals see J. J. M. Roberts, Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah (OTL), 167, 169.

> v 2 אׇסֹ֙ף אׇסֵ֜ף and v 3 אׇסֵ֙ף1 and אׇסֵ֤ף2 The thrice repeated אׇסֵף of M is the hifil of √סוף, but the initial inf. abs. is the qal of √אסף. The similarity of meaning between the two verbs makes it difficult to be sure how the vrss. vocalized each of the four words, whose consonantal text is identical. Only T introduces a distinction of verbs, but with a different distribution from M, rendering the two in v. 2 by √שׁיצי and those in v. 3 by √סוף. G V S render throughout by the same verb, which seems to reflect √אסף (see G’s rendering of this verb in Isa 60:20 and Hos 4:3, and S’s rendering of it in Gen 30:23). The fragmentary evidence of Ḥev (Συ}ναγωγῃ̑ συν{) suggests that it too rendered by συνάγειν (= אסף).


> The construction with the inf. abs. qal (אָסֹף) produces an intensification of the statement (“completely”). The second verb form, however, (אָסֵף) appears to be pointed incorrectly: the expected 1st. pers. sing. of the impf. in the continuation should be אֶאֱסֹף, perhaps contracted to אֹסַף. In this case and in v. 3 it is usually corrected tacitly, cf. BHS. (Sweeney, Zephaniah, 61, on the other hand argues that the Masoretic pointing shows that one should read a hiphil from סוף, “make an end”—which is not otherwise attested!)

- Dietrich, IECOT, 1:2 note a:

Dietrich merely argues for a different pointing of MT, with both roots being from אָסַף, from אׇסֵ֜ף to "perhaps a contracted" אֹסַף (contracted form of אֶאֱסֹף):

Says the expected continuation from the inf. abs. was the 1s impf.

NOTE! This would be perfect assonance! Instead of MT:

אָסֹ֨ף אָסֵ֜ף
to:
אָסֹ֨ף אֹסַף

With ah-oh -> oh-ah chiastic match of the vowels!

## Adele is best here

In the end and after some consideration, especially considering the proclivity towards assonance in the prophets (God's own proclivities that is!), I gladly adopt Adele's positions here:

> Attempts like these to force both words into the same root are not especially satisfying. It seems more plausible that on occasion one may find an infinite absolute plus finite verb from two different but related roots, especially defective roots. Compare Jer 8:13 and Isa 28:28. 

* אָסֹ֥ף אֲסִיפֵ֖ם נְאֻם־יְהֹוָ֑ה אֵין֩ עֲנָבִ֨ים בַּגֶּ֜פֶן וְאֵ֧ין תְּאֵנִ֣ים בַּתְּאֵנָ֗ה ־ ירמ ח,יג

I'm not sure about Is 28:28 on quick look.


> The effect produces greater assonance, an important feature in prophetic speech, without sacrificing meaning (Gerleman, 2). Or, alternatively, one may note that some defective roots occur in alternate forms: e.g., ṭwb and yṭb [טוב and יטב], ysr and ʾsr. 

So, see:

HAL: יטב: alternative form of טוב ... impf. (also represents impf. of טוב) יִ(י)טַב, תֵּיטְבִי Nah 3:8 (alternative form of qal and hif. or text error ?... וַיִּיטְבוּ: , ... יִיטַב לוֹ/לָהּ

כַּאֲשֶׁר֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ ־ ברא מ,יד

> Either of these explanations allows us to view the MT as acceptable, without resorting to complicated emendations. Stylistically related to the alternation of roots in 1:2 may be the alternation in verbal form (binyan) in 2:1. The roots swp and ʾsp [סוף and אסף] are not semantically distant. Swp is commonly used to mean “end, finish” and ʾsp also connotes “destruction, ending, withdrawal” in Jud 18:25; Hos 4:3; Isa 60:20; Joel 2:10; 4:15.

- Adele, Zephaniah, 72

But how is it that these two totally different roots "[סוף and אסף] are not semantically distant"? Just a coincidence? It would be very easy to argue, yes, just a coincidence, as we can easily see how the negative sense of אסף (into “destruction, ending, withdrawal”) developed from the 'gathering' sense. Even so, ... how convenient that they still have, in this partial semantic sense (the negative sense) a strong connection. To the agnostic academic community, no mystical connection could be brooked here, though they could be convinced of this connection purely on human grounds, BASED ON word-selection that evolved / developed by the native speakers developing this negative sense in the word אסף, in part based on their already usage of the word סוף. ALL of that based on audible / assonance connections we must strongly underline, these are vocalic connections first, not written.

## On the fluid interconnection of Hebrew lemmas?!

This is a passionate subject of mine: I believe our scholarly categorization of lemmas has a real shortcoming in making things more 'fixed' than they had it, they being the biblical Hebrews, and YHWH himself! I am well aware that there are no end of popular level, off the beaten path and non-academic theories, that get mystical and so forth, and can go way too far in postualting some kind of mystical connection between different words / lemmas, based on whatever mystical (often vocalic) theory they are working from. But to sidestep those extremes ... I think among other things that the so called "folk-etymologies" (referring to biblical peoples themselves, like the wives of Jacob when naming their sons) prove that the Hebrews THEMSELVES were not aligned with the rigid separation of lemmas that scholars have given us today, in the tradition of Aristotle etc. WHAT to do with this and where to draw the proper line is a hard question. But critically, I believe YHWH Himself is not in our "academic" camp. YHWH and the Hebrews seem more than willing to see connections between different roots that had assonance between each other, in cases where we would scoff.

## meaning

Dietrich on the puzzling problem of asaf being just as easily positive as negative:

> The beginning of the text is puzzling and unsettling in equal measure. The verb “gather in” (אסף) produces an iridiscent play of colors. On the one hand it can mean the bringing in of the harvest or collecting food (e.g. Exod 23:10; Num 11:32). This association is established by its use in combination with the noun אדמה, “farmland, fields.” On the other hand, it can take on a threatening tone and   p 204  designate the “taking away” (e.g., of peace in Jer 16:5 or of life in Ps 104:29) or even the “wiping out” of humans (1 Sam 15:6). In the narrative of the Flood, the phrase “away from the face of the fields” appears many times; is that being alluded to here?
