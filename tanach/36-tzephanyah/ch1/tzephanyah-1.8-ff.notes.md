# Tzephanyah 1:8-ff Notes


Sacrifice:

כִּ֤י קָרוֹב֙ י֣וֹם יְהוָ֔ה כִּֽי־הֵכִ֧ין יְהוָ֛ה זֶ֖בַח

> Roberts (Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah, 177–78) is probably more on target when he writes: “The Judeans would not eat the sacrificial meal Yahweh was preparing, however, for the implication of Zephaniah’s words is that Judah would be the sacrifice (cf. Isa 34:6–7; Jer 46:10)! Yawheh’s guests, consecrated by him to eat the sacrifice (see 1 Sam 16:5 for this practice) would not be the Judeans, but either the foreign armies he would bring against Judah (Isa 13:3–5) or the birds and beasts of prey who would feed on the corpses of the dead (Ezek 39:17–20).”

- Barker NAC 427, nt 106

Isa 34:6–7 !

חֶ֣רֶב לַיהוָ֞ה מָלְאָ֥ה דָם֙ הֻדַּ֣שְׁנָה מֵחֵ֔לֶב ... כִּ֣י זֶ֤בַח לַֽיהוָה֙ בְּבָצְרָ֔ה וְטֶ֥בַח גָּד֖וֹל בְּאֶ֥רֶץ אֱדֽוֹם׃

Day of YHWH directly called a "sacrifice", with slaughtering of all kinds of bulls / rams etc

Jer 46:10

> וְֽהַיּ֨וֹם הַה֜וּא לַאדֹנָ֧י יְהוִ֣ה צְבָא֗וֹת י֤וֹם נְקָמָה֙ לְהִנָּקֵ֣ם מִצָּרָ֔יו וְאָכְלָ֥ה חֶ֙רֶב֙ וְשָׂ֣בְעָ֔ה וְרָוְתָ֖ה מִדָּמָ֑ם כִּ֣י זֶ֠בַח לַאדֹנָ֨י יְהוִ֧ה צְבָא֛וֹת בְּאֶ֥רֶץ צָפ֖וֹן אֶל־נְהַר־פְּרָֽת׃


> Thus Zephaniah “takes the word of divine grace (the provision of a sacrifice for sin) and makes it the vehicle of the message of wrath: those who have long despised the sacrifice that God provides become the sacrifice their sin merits.” - Barker, 428

Pakad פקד - 'visit' / punish

Fascinating! --> 

> It is probable that David’s “census” of II Sam 24 was also not just a head count to satisfy a monarch’s pride, but was again a preparation for some ill-conceived military adventure. Notice that Joab, the commander of the army, was charged with the mustering and that he had strong objections to it. R.L.H.] - TWOT, פקד

For more context immed above:

> [It may be noted that the so-called census in Num 1 concerns only the adult men “able to go forth to war” (v. 20). It was more than a census; it was an organizing of the troops for battle “by their armies” (v. 3). It was the mustering of the troops in preparation for Moses’ invasion of Canaan from Kadesh Barnea.

Both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE at once, just like "lift up the head" with Joseph and the wine-bearer / butler:

> When translated “visit,” as fifty-seven times in the KJV (RSV the same in many of these occurrences), this word almost always has the sense, now largely obsolete, of “making a visitation” and points to action that produces a great change in the position of a subordinate either for good or for ill. Speiser suggests a close parallel to the phrase “to raise the head,” used in Gen 40:13,19 for Pharaoh’s treatment both of the butler and of the baker, one to be restored to his position in the court and the other to be hanged. The word pāqad is similarly used in what might seem to be two opposite senses in Jer 23:2. There are many instances where “visit” means to inflict injury or harm and Rsv translates many of these as “punish.” However, in a considerable number of cases it is clear that the “visitation” produces a beneficial result, e.g. Gen 50:24–25, Ruth 1:6, I Sam 2:21; Ps 8:4 [H 5] Jer 15:15; 29:10. In Isa 24:21 the evil forces that God imprisons for a season are “visited” by him after many days. Scholars divide about equally as to whether “visit” here means punish or release, with Delitzsch and Calvin leaning toward the latter interpretation. - TWOT, ibid

מִרְמָֽה - v8

הַֽמְמַלְאִ֛ים בֵּ֥ית אֲדֹנֵיהֶ֖ם חָמָ֥ס וּמִרְמָֽה׃

see qz verses, and then esp Prov 11:1, and 11:1-5 as a whole, the treacherous vs the righteous / saving in day of trouble

v9 - 

> What exactly does it mean to “avoid stepping on the threshold”? The NIV footnote equates this practice with the worship of Dagon among the Philistines as found in 1 Sam 5:4–5. Many pagans believed that evil spirits resided at the threshold, waiting for someone to step on it and let them slip in.126 This interpretation relates the practice in Judah with pagan worship, perhaps for the same reasons as wearing foreign clothes in the preceding   p 431  verse. “They observe the minutia of a senseless pagan law, but then run rampant over the basic ordinances of God in his own house.” - Barker, 430-1

v12 - 

"who thicken on their sediment" 

> NET nt: "“who thicken on their sediment.” The imagery comes from wine making, where the wine, if allowed to remain on the sediment too long, will thicken into syrup. The image suggests that the people described here were complacent in their sinful behavior and interpreted the delay in judgment as divine apathy."
