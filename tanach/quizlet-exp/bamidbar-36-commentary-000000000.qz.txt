## Bamidbar 36

Note 36:1
+
The leaders of Zelophehad’s own clan of the tribe of Manasseh (cf. Num 27:1) approached Moses with their concerns over the future status of ancestral land pursuant to the rulings of Numbers 27:1–11. They refer to Zelophehad as ʾaḥînû “our kinsman” in the next verse, Numbers 36:2. They are logically the ones who would be most concerned." - Levine, Numbers 21–36, Anchor 2008, 576–577. NP: because without this correction, their own clan's ancestral inheritance would be LOST to another tribe

rāʾšê ʾābôt, 36:1, Levine, Anchor
+
"The term rāʾšê ʾābôt “heads of patriarchal families” seems to represent an abbreviation of rāʾšê bêt ʾabôt (cf. Exod 6:14 with Exod 6:25 and Num 31:26 with Num 7:2). This term also occurs in 1 Chronicles 7:11, 2 Chronicles 19:8, Ezra 2:68//Nehemiah 7:71. There are other combinations in use, such as rāʾšê ʾabôt hammaṭṭôt “the patriarchal heads of the tribes” (Num 32:28, Jos 21:1), and rāʾšê ʾabôt hāʿēdāh “the patriarchal heads of the community” (Num 3:26). It appears that the nomenclature is flexible at this point. In the present verse, the rāʾšê ʾabôt of the “clans” (mispāḥôt) of the tribe of Manasseh appeared before Moses and the chieftains (neśiʾim) of the Israelites. But as we read on, the neśiʾîm themselves are designated rāʾšê ʾābôt! The term mispāḥāḥ “clan” would appear to be quite stable, however. -- Levine, Numbers, 577.
