Locusts NET note
+
The four Hebrew terms used in this verse are of uncertain meaning. English translations show a great deal of variation in dealing with these... Whether these [four] words represent different life-stages of the locusts, or whether virtual synonyms are being used to underscore the severity of damage caused by the relentless waves of locust invasion, is not entirely certain. The latter seems more likely. Many interpreters have understood the locust plagues described here to be symbolic of invading armies that will devastate the land, but the symbolism could also work the other way, with real plagues of locusts described in the following verses as an invading army.

Niphal נָגַשׁ - NIDDOTE note
+
2. Instead of having a pass. ni., נָגַשׁ is a mixed root that uses a q. impf. but a ni. pf. (GKC 220; Waltke-O'Connor, IBHS 392-93). The seventeen occurrences of the ni. have the same basic meanings as the q. The hi. is used much like those of בּוֹא and קָרַב. As a "two-place Hiphil," it is used when one brings an offering to God (Lev 2:8 contains the hi. of all three roots).
