imperf 3mp "Hophal" of נכה, by-form נכא
Obv a highly 'weak' form, R1 נ, R3 ה, with R1 נ in most forms completely subsumed, but its presence is always represented with the doubling of R2
Other than ONE occurence in Niphal and Pual, all others are Hiphil or its passive form; and the perfect pass. forms have the ה prefix, thus certainly passive of Hiphil. A *so called* "Hophal", though as you can see in both perf and imperf the R1 binyan vowel is an orange U / ooo, a Huphal 😉
