ICC syntax note : וְקָרָ֨א זֶ֤ה אֶל־זֶה֙ וְאָמַ֔ר
+
"On the understanding of the syntax of this passage indicated above, וקרא **continues the participles and imperfects of the circumstantial clauses in vv. 1b-2**, before the narrative sequence is resumed in v. 4; so rightly, in this respect, GK §112k; JM §119v; cf. Driver, Tenses §120. 1QIsa reads וקראים and omits ואמר. This undoubtedly indicates the same understanding of the syntax (contra Pulikottil, 114-15)"

קָד֧וֹשׁ׀ קָד֛וֹשׁ קָד֖וֹשׁ יְהוָ֣ה צְבָא֑וֹת מְלֹ֥א כָל־הָאָ֖רֶץ כְּבוֹדֽוֹ

"Holy, holy holy, is YHWH of Armies, his glory is the fulness (/is filling?) of the earth" - Is 6:3, ICC

קָד֧וֹשׁ (Shmuelof)
+
Kadosh, Shmuelof
---
3 וקראים זה אל זה קדוש קדוש יהוה צבאות מלא כול הארץ כבודו (1QIsa^a)
+
Is 6:3 - 1QIsa^a - radically different!
ICC (Will.): "It [kadosh] appears only twice in 1QIsa, rather as a repetition was avoided by the scroll in v. 2. While either text is possible, MT is generally preferred," ... !! This and other examples like the total altering and cutting of words at beginning of the verse shows abundantly clearly 1QIsa^a was of a translational nature, such as for clarification or simplification purposes!
---
מְלֹא
+
'that which fills' (ICC, "is the equivalent of...")
---
מְלֹ֥א כָל־הָאָ֖רֶץ כְּבוֹדֽוֹ
+
ICC: 'his glory is the fulness of the earth'
"this may justify the looser but traditional rendering, 'the whole earth is full of his glory', attested already in the versions from the LXX on)
---
ויִמָּלא
+
wawcon (imperf) of מְלֹ֥א
ICC: "... ____ ('and may it be filled') into the construct noun מלא ('the fulness of')..."

JPS Fishbane note on 6:3
+
"His presence fills all the earth! God's "presence" (kavod) refers to the manifestation of the divine Glory in history (Lev. 10:3; Isa. 40:5). Indeed, such appearances have a sensible and numinous aspect—something akin to the radiant penumbra (or melammu) of the divine mentioned in ancient Mesopotamian sources. This distinct presence often has a marked anthropomorphic appearance. The visionary experiences of Moses (Exod. 33:22-23) and Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:28) are striking cases in point. But they pose a problem of interpretation for Isa. 6:3. Just what is the meaning of the seraphs' praise (that "His kavod fills all the earth")? Is something more intended here than a glorification of divine immanence or omnipresence? There is no conclusive answer; however, based on the previous sources, it appears that the reference is to a world-encompassing figure in heaven. Seated on high, surrounded by angels, the lower train of God's garment fills the earthly Temple—hence the seraphs proclaim that His kavod fills the entire earth. A further trace of this notion is also palpable in God's own remark to the postexilic community: "The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool: Where could you build a house for Me, what place could serve as My abode?" (Isa. 66:1).

אַמּ֣וֹת הַסִּפִּ֔ים notes
+
"The doorposts of the threshold" - ICC (Will.)
HAL (II סַף): "the stone under the door-frame, in which the אַמּוֹת pivots of the doors revolve and, if they are made of basalt, rumble and bang Is 6:4 (Wildberger BK 10/1:232, 251);"

ICC: "The doorposts of the threshold: the details here are uncertain (see the notes above) but fortunately this is not too important. Most agree that we are dealing here with something related to the structure of the doorway, and what matters is that it shook at the sound of the cry of one of the Seraphim. The immediate conceptual trigger may possibly be Amos 9:1, where again rather unusually the thresholds shake, though a different verb is used there (רעש). Our verb, נוע, occurs only very rarely in relevant contexts"
