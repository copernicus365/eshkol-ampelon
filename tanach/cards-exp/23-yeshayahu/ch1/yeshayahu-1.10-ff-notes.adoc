==== 1:10

hi

=== 1:10 rulers || and 3:4-9 ff SOCIETAL COLLAPSE

Rulers, commanders of SODOM

Ruling and order and society itself FAILING. As the people fail, society fails, who is there to "pick up the slack"?

> And He will make boys their rulers, ... 5 So the people shall oppress one another... The young shall bully the old; ... “Come, be a chief over us, And let this ruin be under your care,” ... 7 he other will thereupon protest, “I will not be a dresser of wounds, ... You shall not make me chief of a people!”

Then v. 8 ANSWERS why this has happened!

> Ah, Jerusalem has stumbled, And Judah has fallen, Because by word and deed They insult the LORD, Defying His majestic glance.

v 7:
> וּבְבֵיתִ֕י אֵ֥ין לֶ֖חֶם וְאֵ֣ין שִׂמְלָ֑ה לֹ֥א תְשִׂימֻ֖נִי קְצִ֥ין עָֽם׃

DEMOCRACY... :0) Man is to rule (Gen 1), but how surely our hope is not in man, tov lahasot ba-yy
