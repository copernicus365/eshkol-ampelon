# Daniel 2 YouTube description / title


## Description 

(YouTube description / title)

I’ve been relearning and refreshing Biblical Aramaic lately, and have spent much time in Daniel chapter 2, along with my old friend and teacher Dr Isaac Yerushalmi (via his red Ezra and Daniel philological commentary, with own copious colored notes, and his mp3 recordings). In the process, I always found it very insightful when Yerushalmi would translate snippets of the Aramaic into Hebrew. And I got the idea to look for a whole translation of the Aramaic into Hebrew, thinking how useful it would be to read them side by side. Well I found one of these, by Gordon (below), שמואל ליב גורדון.

The markdown text you see me reading from was a bit of a painstaking work I did to combine the Aramaic and the Hebrew translation (I also have this for all of Daniel, thank you Mr Gordon! ז״ל)

Ultimately, I think few things are more beneficial for learning the language than 

1. HEARING text, and 

2. this kind of side by side coexistence / constant comparative Semitics method of hearing/reading the Aramaic alongside the Hebrew.

I am very eager to have something like this available soon, God willing (please pray with me about this! 🙏🏻), for the Old Testament Peshitta, because I have the vocalized text now, but it’s not released yet. The point being, it would be lovely to be able to have readings from the Tanach alongside vocalized Syriac renderings just like this (in reverse! Aramaic / Syriac being the translation).

On the Gordon Hebrew translation which I’m using and this side by side text I prepared:
